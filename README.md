# OmicronVariantAnalysis

A few days ago, the WHO designated a new variant of the coronavirus, B.1.1.529, as a variant of concern which has been named Omicron. 
Right after that, we saw an outbreak of tweets about the Omicron variant on Twitter.

The dataset that I am using for the task of Omicron sentiment analysis is downloaded from Kaggle, which was initially collected from Twitter 
when people were sharing their opinions about the Omicron variant. So letâ€™s start the task of Omicron sentiment analysis by importing the necessary 
Python libraries and the dataset.
